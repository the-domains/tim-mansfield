For the last few months, I've been working at [Authentic Sydney][0] helping out with facilitation and teaching and wrangling some of the online community stuff. This work is important to me because I feel that greater authenticity and transparency is a (not so) hidden key to transforming organisational life.

[Khali][1], [Mary][2] and I offered [our first full-day workshop][3] last month, based on Susan Campbell's very thorough book, "[Getting Real][4]". It was our first outing as a facilitation team and we got some great feedback from our lovely participants.

We learned a lot and now we're back in the lab cooking up something new. Watch this space.
