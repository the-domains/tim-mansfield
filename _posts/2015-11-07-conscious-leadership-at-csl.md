For the last couple of years, the folks at the [Centre for Sustainability Leadership][0] have invited me to talk to their [Fellowship program][1] about "Conscious Leadership". The Fellows are at the start of an 8 month program to develop their capacity as sustainability leaders. It's a very diverse group of people, but I find them all so inspiring.

My talk this year focused on what I call the three Integrative Journeys of life: the journey to depth, the journey to acceptance and the journey to complexity.

_Depth_in these terms is the sense of presence and spaciousness that characterises long-term meditation practice.

_Acceptance_, or self-acceptance, is what arises from extensive work in overcoming the hard boundaries between ego (the conscious self) and shadow (the repressed self).

_Complexity_, or the capacity to handle and hold complexity, is what arises in the process of structural development.

All three are enormous topics and I can only touch on them in an evening, but we danced with it all a little and we had some time for a couple of brief, experiential exercises.

Lots of discussion, many rich, sweet conversations at the end in a discussion that spilled over to the pub. I'm enormously grateful to Jeremy Mah at CSL for inviting me along and giving me a chance to connect with this amazing group of people.
